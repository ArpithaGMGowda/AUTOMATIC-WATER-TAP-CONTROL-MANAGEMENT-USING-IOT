# AUTOMATIC-WATER-TAP-CONTROL-MANAGEMENT-USING-IOT

**ABSTRACT**

In this busy world everybody is interested in making their routine works automated and also want to monitor the elderly people and patients at home. While talking about proper water management, we humans underestimate some of the facts like Running the tap while brushing your teeth can waste 4 gallons of water, Leaky faucets that drip at the rate of one drop per second can waste up to 2,700 gallons of water each year, Showering and bathing are the largest indoor uses (27%) of water domestically, about 95% of the water entering our homes goes down the drain.Our idea is to apply a proper water management technique in our homes.  We are targeting to save water from leaky and running taps by automating our domestic tap.


**PROBLEM SOLUTION DESIGN**

Usually, most of the water tap in the market usually use old system where it using manually control to turn on or turn off the system. When the users using that system, they must use their hand to open or close the water tap and the water tap valve easy to damage because when the users always turn strongly to open or close the tap. This system is not efficient because water wastage easy to occur because at the time between to open the tap and wash their hand the water has already been wasted. It same when we want to close it and if we forgot to close the water tap it will make waste become more critical. As we can see usage of sink only focus on one usage it is all about water. Looking at the development of technology today usage of sink should not be focused on water use only because user needs something their use can give many benefit when they use it. Another disadvantage for the system is when users wash their hands, their hands not very clean because they still have a direct contact to the messy water tap where it exposes to the bacteria.
